        Instead, see :doc:`/deploying/index` for WSGI server recommendations.

        If the :attr:`debug` flag is set the server will automatically reload
        for code changes and show a debugger in case an exception happened.

        If you want to run the application in debug mode, but disable the

        It is not recommended to use this function for development with

           interactive debugger without the code reloading, you have to
           invoke :meth:`run` with ``debug=True`` and ``use_reloader=False``.
           Setting ``use_debugger`` to ``True`` without being in debug mode
           won't catch any exceptions because there won't be any to
           catch.

            if present.
        :param port: the port of the webserver. Defaults to ``5000`` or the
            port defined in the ``SERVER_NAME`` config variable if present.
        :param debug: if given, enable or disable debug mode. See
            :attr:`debug`.

        Instead, see :doc:`/deploying/index` for WSGI server recommendations.

        If the :attr:`debug` flag is set the server will automatically reload
        for code changes and show a debugger in case an exception happened.

        If you want to run the application in debug mode, but disable the

        It is not recommended to use this function for development with
        automatic reloading as this is badly supported.  Instead you should

           interactive debugger without the code reloading, you have to
           invoke :meth:`run` with ``debug=True`` and ``use_reloader=False``.
           Setting ``use_debugger`` to ``True`` without being in debug mode
           won't catch any exceptions because there won't be any to
           catch.

        :param port: the port of the webserver. Defaults to ``5000`` or the
            port defined in the ``SERVER_NAME`` config variable if present.
        :param debug: if given, enable or disable debug mode. See
            :attr:`debug`.

        about unit testing head over to :doc:`/testing`.

        Note that if you are testing for assertions or exceptions in your
        application code, you must set ``app.testing = True`` in order for the
        exceptions to propagate to the test client.  Otherwise, the exception
        will be handled by the application (not visible to the test client) and
        the only indication of an AssertionError or other exception will be a
        500 status code response to the test client.  See the :attr:`testing`
        attribute.  For example::

            app.testing = True
            client = app.test_client()

        The test client can be used in a ``with`` block to defer the closing down
        of the context until the end of the ``with`` block.  This is useful if
        you want to access the context locals for testing::

            with app.test_client() as c:
                rv = c.get('/?vodka=42')
                assert request.args['vodka'] == '42'

        Additionally, you may pass optional keyword arguments that will then
        be passed to the application's :attr:`test_client_class` constructor.
        For example::

            from flask.testing import FlaskClient

            class CustomClient(FlaskClient):
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    self._authentication = kwargs.pop("authentication")

            app.test_client_class = CustomClient

        Do not use ``run()`` in a production setting. It is not intended to
        meet security and performance requirements for a production server.
        Instead, see :doc:`/deploying/index` for WSGI server recommendations.

        If the :attr:`debug` flag is set the server will automatically reload
        for code changes and show a debugger in case an exception happened.

        If you want to run the application in debug mode, but disable the
        code execution on the interactive debugger, you can pass
        ``use_evalex=False`` as parameter.  This will keep the debugger's
        traceback screen active, but disable code execution.

        It is not recommended to use this function for development with
        automatic reloading as this is badly supported.  Instead you should
        be using the :command:`flask` command line script's ``run`` support.

        .. admonition:: Keep in Mind

           Flask will suppress any server error with a generic error page
           unless it is in debug mode.  As such to enable just the
           interactive debugger without the code reloading, you have to
           invoke :meth:`run` with ``debug=True`` and ``use_reloader=False``.
           Setting ``use_debugger`` to ``True`` without being in debug mode
           won't catch any exceptions because there won't be any to
           catch.

        :param host: the hostname to listen on. Set this to ``'0.0.0.0'`` to
            have the server available externally as well. Defaults to
            ``'127.0.0.1'`` or the host in the ``SERVER_NAME`` config variable
            if present.
        :param port: the port of the webserver. Defaults to ``5000`` or the
            port defined in the ``SERVER_NAME`` config variable if present.
        :param debug: if given, enable or disable debug mode. See
            :attr:`debug`.
        :param load_dotenv: Load the nearest :file:`.env` and :file:`.flaskenv`
            files to set environment variables. Will also change the working
            directory to the directory containing the first file found.
        :param options: the options to be forwarded to the underlying Werkzeug
            server. See :func:`werkzeug.serving.run_simple` for more
            information.

        Note that if you are testing for assertions or exceptions in your

        exceptions to propagate to the test client.  Otherwise, the exception
        will be handled by the application (not visible to the test client) and
        the only indication of an AssertionError or other exception will be a
        500 status code response to the test client.  See the :attr:`testing`
        attribute.  For example::

            app.testing = True
            client = app.test_client()

        The test client can be used in a ``with`` block to defer the closing down
        of the context until the end of the ``with`` block.  This is useful if

        be passed to the application's :attr:`test_client_class` constructor.
        For example::

            from flask.testing import FlaskClient

            class CustomClient(FlaskClient):
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
